# Matt's queue

Everything waiting on Matt in this project, **most important first**. Deadlines come first, then items blocking other work, then the rest.

- **Matt:** say "give me your top issue" (or "the next one") and you get the first item that is not yet Answered. Answer it in a line.
- **Status** (every item has one):
  - **Waiting**: in the queue, not yet asked.
  - **Asked (date)**: put to Matt.
  - **Answered (date)**: Matt replied; his answer is written in the item, word for word.
  - **Processed**: acted on. Move the item to `docs/matt-queue-archive.md` (newest first) and renumber the queue.
- **Agents:** when you need Matt to decide or do something, add it here with **Status: Waiting**, in priority order, in the format below. Never leave an ask only in chat: Matt reads in bursts, runs several agents at once, and doesn't carry context between messages. After his answer:
  1. set Answered with his words;
  2. act on it and record the decision where this project keeps decisions;
  3. set Processed and move the item to the archive.
- **Format** (each item must read cold, with no shorthand from earlier conversations, and no PR numbers or internal names as the explanation):
  - title (with a deadline if any);
  - **Status**;
  - **What** (plain words);
  - **Why it matters**;
  - **Options**, if more than one;
  - **Recommendation**;
  - **Reply** (the exact words to say);
  - **Answer** (added when Answered).
- **grokbot** reads this file (and the same file in Matt's other projects) to answer "what are my top issues?". It lists items that are Waiting or Asked.

Nothing waiting on Matt right now.
